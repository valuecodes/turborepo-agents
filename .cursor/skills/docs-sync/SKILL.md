description: Synchronize and update documentation across the monorepo. Use when you need to "update docs", "propagate" changes, run "pnpm test" docs validation, or modify "README", "AGENTS.md", "CLAUDE.md", or ".codex" files consistently.

# Docs Sync

Keep documentation consistent and up-to-date across the Turborepo monorepo. When updating commands, configs, or patterns, propagate changes to all relevant doc files to avoid stale references.

## Scope

Documentation files to consider:

- `README*` (root and workspace READMEs)
- `docs/**` (dedicated documentation directory)
- `**/AGENTS.md` (agent-specific guidance in root, apps, and packages)
- `**/CLAUDE.md` (Claude Code instructions in root, apps, and packages)
- `.codex/**` (Codex agent configs and skills)
- `.claude/**` (Claude Code settings, hooks, and skills)
- `.cursor/**` (Cursor editor configs)
- `.github/**` (GitHub workflows and templates, including `copilot-instructions.md`)
- App/package-specific docs (e.g., `apps/*/README.md`, `packages/*/README.md`)

## Workflow

1. **Find doc files**: Scan for all documentation files listed in Scope.
2. **Update references consistently**: When changing a command, path, or pattern, update ALL occurrences across all doc files. Never partially update.
3. **Add/update explanations**: When changing a command or config, add or update a short explanation of what it does and why.
4. **Run formatter**: Execute `pnpm format` to ensure consistent formatting.
5. **Run validation**: Execute `pnpm turbo lint typecheck` to catch any issues. If a docs build exists, run it too.
6. **Summarize changes**: Report files changed and flag anything that needs human review.

## Guidelines

- Keep docs concise and scannable
- Use consistent terminology across all files
- Prefer examples over lengthy explanations
- Update version numbers/dates if present
- Remove obsolete sections rather than leaving stale content
- When adding new commands, include both the command and a brief explanation

## Output Requirements

Always finish with a summary:

- **Files changed**: List of documentation files modified
- **What to review**: Any changes that need human verification (e.g., explanations that may need refinement, removed sections)
- **Validation status**: Results of `pnpm format` and `pnpm turbo lint typecheck`
